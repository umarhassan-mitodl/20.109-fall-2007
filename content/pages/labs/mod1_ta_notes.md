## General Notes

Notes: NB271 is a strain that can be selected for on LB-Kan media. It does not contain the M13KO7 plasmid, but it has the F pilus that is necessary for M13KO7 to infect it. NB251 is also a strain that can be selected for on LB-Kan- it contains the M13KO7 plasmid.

Before term begins:

1. Pour several liters of LB+Kan (~2L) and LB (~4L) plates.
2. Streak out NB251 (M13KO7) on LB+Kan. Make 16 overnight cultures (each 2.5 ml LB+Kan). Miniprep these for the vector DNA the next day. Resuspend each pellet in 50 µl H{{< sub "2" >}}O. You do not have to pool since each group in the class will be given one tube for their cloning experiment that starts on Day1 of the module. Store at -20°.
3. Double-check volume of needed oligos: for cloning control, for sequencing.
4. NEB titers M13KO7 on their strain ER2267 cat#E4103S. This strain is in the lab collection as NB271. Streak out a plate on LB+Kan so you will have colonies to pick for liquid cultures before phage titration. The Kan is important to select for the F'. This is just to check that the phage stock is still active.
5. Autoclave several racks of small and large test tubes.
6. Make 1L top agar, divide between autoclaved 250 ml bottles, 100 ml per bottle for reheating
7. Check volume/availability of needed kits, reagents:
    - {{% resource_link "1cab9e78-0d3b-4311-8888-f7d30ec642ae" "M13KO7 from NEB" %}}
    - restriction enzymes (BamHI, others on list of no cutters ({{% resource_link "924b6822-9024-9203-b914-75da7d476398" "TXT" %}}))
    - Qiagen kit for agarose clean-up (need 1/pair of students)
    - T4 DNA ligase and buffer for ligation mix
    - super competent XL1-blue cells (need one tube of 200 µl/pair of students)
    - miniprep solutions
    - protein gels (need 3/lab section)
    - Anti-p3 antibody

## Daily Notes

### Day 1

Before lab:

1. Need to have plasmid for restriction digest, each group gest one miniprep of NB251

Day of lab:

1. No quiz on day 1
2. Keep cold:
    - PCR tubes with 10 µl BamH1
    - NEB buffer 2 on ice
3. Remember to freeze away digests (-20C) before leaving lab for the night

### Day 2

Before lab:

2. Need to pour 3 x 100 ml agarose gels for each day of lab, using one 10-well comb (thicker teeth) in each gel.
3. Pour LB plates (2L), 6 plates per group, x 2 days = 72 plates
4. Need top agar prepared
5. Check for phage stocks: M13KO7 and another M13 phage called E4
6. Check reagents and tubes in Qiagen Agarose Cleanup Kit
7. Need 1kb ladder and loading dye

Day of lab:

1. Need quiz (all quizzes 2 or 3 questions, 5 points)
2. Put gels in boxes for running, remove combs, add ~500 ml 1X TAE
3. Need to melt 30 ml of top agar/group. Microwave in water bath for 2', invert to distribute any unmelted parts, heat another minute. (SC: I microwaved 1', swirled, microwaved 30", and it was melted, then into 55C water bath) It's very important that the top agar be fully melted for the students. Store molten in 55-60°C water bath.
4. Bacterial overnights out
5. Pipetmen, 5 ml pipettes and 50C water baths for phage plating
6. 1 PCR tube/group
