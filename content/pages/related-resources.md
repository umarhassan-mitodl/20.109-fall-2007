## Writing Web Links

The following links are helpful places to do further investigation into good writing:

Swan, Judith A., and George D. Gopen. "The Science of Scientific Writing." *American Scientist* 78 (November-December 1990): 550-558. ({{% resource_link "50e285a6-a0dd-4f31-9329-351c4a6274fe" "PDF" %}}) - A very useful article that analyzes the structure and style of scientific writing.

Writing Up Research - A fairly comprehensive explanation of the components of the research article from the Asian Institute of Technology.

Writing in the Neurobiological Sciences - A scientific writing course from the University of Florida with many useful links.

{{% resource_link "37e13b72-8407-4998-9643-84e55008f927" "Writing Guidelines for Engineering and Science Students" %}} - A useful resource on scientific writing from Penn State. Includes many examples and additional links.

{{% resource_link "fbe193db-c33e-4f97-938d-1ea7f3130e3a" "Instructions to Authors in the Health Sciences" %}} - This site provides links to instructions to authors for over 3,500 journals in the health and life sciences.
